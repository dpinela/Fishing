This is a Hollow Knight randomizer connection that adds a fishing minigame to the game. At certain
locations near large bodies of water, you can fish for randomized items.

# How to fish

Approach the shore, and interact with the fishing location. While sitting down there, there will be periodic splashes in the water; press your nail button just after one to fish out an item. If more than
10 seconds pass without any splash, the location has been depleted and will yield no more items.

If you catch an item but leave the room without collecting it, you can catch it again at the same location.

# Locations

There are 11 fishing spots, all located on the shores of Hallownest's largest bodies of water:

- Lake of Unn
- Bottom of Distant Village
- The west and east shores of Blue Lake
- The central pool in Waterways (by the grub)
- The waterways mask shard room pool
- The west shore of the long acid pool above Isma's Grove
- The pool east of the Abyss Lighthouse (doesn't require the void to be calm)
- Junk Pit
- Bottom of Godhome Atrium
- The pool west of Pale Lurker

All locations can yield multiple items, and appear in RandoMapMod with a special fish icon.
